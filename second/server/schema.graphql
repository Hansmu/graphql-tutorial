# You can define a custom object using the same syntax as the base query.
# type FollowedByTheName
# Now when we want to query it, we can write a query like:
# query {
#   job {
#       title
#       description
#   }   
# }
# There are a bunch of scalar fields, but in addition to common ones, there's the ID
# The ID signifies that it doesn't need to be human readable, and it can be used by GraphQL for whatever an ID would be used
